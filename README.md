Here you can find a backup of the project codes and the code for loading the database, which can be used to test the results.

All projects use the same database, which is about an online movie rental shop, its customers and the payments they made.\
There are several questions answered, each using different sets of clauses. There is also an extra insight called "Finding Susan" showcasing critical thinking skills.

The projects were created using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4.

The code to load the database was licenced by Copyright (c) Devrim Gündüz <https://www.gunduz.org/>.
